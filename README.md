# GIS-Based Delineation of Potential Groundwater Harvesting Zones
**Academic GIS Project – RMIT University**

## Overview
Increasing groundwater demand and climate variability have placed growing pressure on global groundwater resources. This project applies a GIS-based approach to identify potential groundwater harvesting zones by integrating seven hydrogeological and environmental factors—lithology, geomorphology, land use, slope, drainage density, rainfall, and soil—using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP).

## Project Context
This work was completed as part of a postgraduate GIS unit at RMIT University and
is shared here in a curated form to demonstrate methodological and analytical
capabilities.

## Methodology (Summary)
• Selection of groundwater-influencing parameters  
• Standardisation and weighting of thematic layers  
• GIS-based weighted overlay analysis  
• Classification of groundwater potential zones 

## Methodological Framework
A GIS-based multi-criteria evaluation framework was adopted to delineate potential
groundwater harvesting zones.

### Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)

The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied to determine the relative
importance of groundwater-influencing factors. A standardised pairwise comparison
matrix was constructed, and the consistency of judgments was evaluated using the
consistency ratio (CR) following Saaty’s method to ensure acceptable logical
consistency.

### Groundwater Potential Index (GWPI)

The groundwater potential index was computed using a weighted linear combination
(WLC) approach (Rahmati et al., 2015), expressed as:

GWPI = Σ (Wⱼ × Xᵢ)

where:
- Wⱼ represents the normalised weight of thematic layer j
- Xᵢ represents the class value within each thematic layer
- m denotes the total number of thematic layers
- n denotes the total number of classes
  
The final groundwater potential zoning was generated by integrating weighted
thematic layers, including lithology (L), geomorphology (G), land use/land cover (LU),
slope (SL), drainage density (DD), rainfall (R), and soil (S), using a GIS-based
weighted overlay technique.



## Key Output
• Groundwater potential zoning map identifying areas of varying suitability
